Healthchain
A blockchain-powered platform that enables secure healthcare data monetization while preserving user privacy. Users can earn rewards for sharing anonymized data, and institutions can obtain AI-driven insights without direct access to raw datasets.

Key Features
Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing â€“ Users can opt-in to share anonymized healthcare data and receive token rewards.
AI-Driven Insights â€“ Instead of accessing raw data, institutions can query an AI model trained on a federated dataset, ensuring complete data privacy.
Decentralized & Secure â€“ Built on blockchain to ensure data integrity and security.
